# Graphiti

Rails style structure for GrapQL API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphiti'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install graphiti

## Usage

### Define GraphQL schema as RoR routes

```ruby
MyGraphqlSchema = Graphiti::Router.draw do |r|
  # will create createUser, updateUser, deleteUser mutations and user, users queries.
  # expects that UsersController class exist
  r.resources :users

  # if you want custom queries or mutation
  r.query 'searchLogs', to: 'logs#search' # redirects request to LogsController
  r.mutation 'changeUserPassword', to: 'users#change_password'
end
```

### Define your Graphql model

```ruby
class User # works with any class including ActiveRecord
  include Graphiti::Model

  graphiti do |c|
    # most common attributes, like :id, :name, :title has default type, so you don't have to specify it (but you can!)
    c.attribute :id

    c.attribute :email, :string
    c.attribute :surname, :string
  end
end
```

### Define controller

```ruby
class UsersController < Graphiti::Controller
  include Graphiti::Controller::CRUD # optional. Adds index/show/create/update/destroy methods

  # graphql requires to describe which attributes controller action accepts and which returns
  specify :change_user_password,
    # optional, no attributes by default ([]). Bang (!) indicates that attribute is required
    accepts: [:password!, :id!],
    # optional. By default it will return model with same name as controller
    returns: User

  def change_user_password
    user = User.find(params[:id])
    user.update!(password: params[:password])

    # returned value needs to have all methods defined in model `graphiti do` part
    user # or SomeDecorator.new(user)
  end

  specify :search,
    accepts: ['customField:string!'],
    returns: [User] # return value is *array* of users

  def search
  end
end
```
